It's something that's visual; it's something that's interactive. It gives them power and it also makes it easy for them to understand, so it's not overwhelming. St\u00e9phane: We\u2019ve seen an evolution in maturity in our clients. They start with just a Web analytics tool and then eventually they want to maybe extract some data and bring it into Excel. And then they start to integrate other sources of data, be it Twitter, Facebook, or their back-office data. But that's going to bring them so far. And when they reach that level where Excel is not enough and they really leap forward and go with something that is much more advanced and will do deeper analysis and bring much more valuable insight, that's where Tableau really comes in and brings them to the next level of analysis. St\u00e9phane: My dream is that eventually we basically on-board our clients into Tableau and make it seamlessly part of our service so that we know from our end that we\u2019re using Tableau and we're gonna be much more efficient in the way that we provide value to our clients. Going beyond the tool and thinking in terms of business value: making the data available so that people can take business decisions on their own. Our role as consultants is to enable that. It's to enable the connectivity of the data, make it available, and make it seamless and ubiquitous so that they have access to the power and the visualizations to make their jobs easier. Melaine: The experience with Tableau as a partnership has been amazing. I can't say that there's ever been a time where I needed some sort of resource help and I haven't gotten it. You know, e-mails, phone calls, you name it, it's on-the-spot information and help which you don\u2019t always get from a partnership. But I have to say that the experience has been amazing. Being here at the Tableau conference has just been an inspiration.

    "stakeholder_engagement": "Thanks to the forecasting and resulting order proposals, we can provide our suppliers with a reliable forecast at any time. Despite the number of items in our assortments having increased enormously in recent years, a staff increase has not been necessary. Board drives a process-led approach, which is why today we order much more efficiently and economically. Full transparency of stock levels and demand now contributes significantly to the optimal distribution of products between individual stores and the central warehouse. Fewer sale items, reduced stock storage, and less warehouse staff combined with smaller quantities have reduced unnecessary costs and released additional liquid funds. We have already been able to gain considerable capital. In addition to cost reduction, the knowledge of expected demand enables long term 'posting' of orders. This ensures that the supplier provides capacity when requested by POLO, keeping delivery rates high, preventing lost sales and ensuring customers are satisfied."
